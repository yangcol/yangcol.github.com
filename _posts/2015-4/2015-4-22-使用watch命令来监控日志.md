How to Tail a Directory in Linux
Posted on July 30, 2012
I’m often tailing log files and whatnot during my development and debugging process. However, I stumbled into a situation where (for various complicated reasons) the best way to solve a problem was to touch files on disk and use those to drive execution. Unfortunately, I didn’t have an easy way to view the live changes to a directory as I stepped through my code. Luckily, where there is will there is a way:

watch "tail -n 3 /var/baoz/stat/workspace/logs/s11.baoz.cn/access/* >> s1.log"

dtrace
